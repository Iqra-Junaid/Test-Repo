    <h1 style=text-align:center;> How to use GitHub </h1>
    <h2> Step 1 : What is GitHub ? </h2>
    <p> GitHub is a highly used software that is typically used for version control. 
      It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. 
      For example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. 
      In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code files. </p>
    <p> <b>First create GitHub Account.</b> </p>
	<h2> Step 2 : How to create a GitHub Repository ? </h2>
    <p> A repository is a storage space where your project lives. 
      It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub  or another online host. 
      You can keep code files, text files, images or any kind of a file in a repository. </p>
    <p> Click on <b>+</b> like button and select new repository. New page will open and asks some details about repository. </p>
    <p> Add these detail and Click <b>create repository</b>. </p>
    <h2> Step 3 : Create Branches and Perform Operations </h2>
    <p> Branches help you to work on different versions of a repository at one time. 
      Let’s say you want to add a new feature (which is in the development phase), and you are afraid at the same time whether to make changes to your main project or not. 
      This is where git branching comes to rescue. Branches allow you to move back and forth between the different states/versions of a project. </p>
    <p> To create a branch in GitHub, follow the below steps:
<ul><li>Click on the dropdown “Branch: main”</li>
<li>As soon as you click on the branch, you can find an existing branch or you can create a new one. </li>
      <li>In my case, I am creating a new branch with a name “readme- changes”. Now write name for branch and click enter button.</li> </ul></p>
    <p> Once you have created a new branch, you have two branches in your repository now i.e. read-me (main branch) and readme- changes. 
      The new branch is just the copy of main branch. So let’s perform some changes in our new branch and make it look different from the main branch. </p>
    <h2> Step 4 : Commit Operation </h2>
    <p> This operation helps you to save the changes in your file. 
      When you commit a file, you should always provide the message, just to keep in the mind the changes done by you. </p>
    <p> Now let’s make our first commit, follow the below steps:
<ul><li>Click on “readme- changes” file which we have just created.</li>
<li>Click on the “edit” or a pencil icon in the righmost corner of the file.
Once you click on that, an editor will open where you can type in the changes or anything.  </li>
<li>Write a commit message which identifies your changes.</li>
      <li>Click commit changes in the end. </li></p>
