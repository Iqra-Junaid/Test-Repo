    <h2 style=margin-left:50px;> What is GitHub ? </h2>
    <p> GitHub is an increasingly popular programming resource used for code sharing. 
	It's a social networking site for programmers that many companies and organizations use to facilitate project management 
	and collaboration.</p>
	<p>GitHub is a highly used software that is typically used for version control. 
      It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. 
      For example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. 
      In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code files. </p>
